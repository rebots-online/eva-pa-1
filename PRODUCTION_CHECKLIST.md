# Production Release Checklist

This document outlines the necessary steps to prepare the application for a production release.

## Phase 1: Pre-Production Feature Implementation

### Billing Integration
- [ ] Research and select the appropriate RevenueCat SDK for a Chrome Extension.
- [ ] Abstract billing logic into a dedicated service/module.
- [ ] Implement RevenueCat initialization and user authentication.
- [ ] Create UI components for subscription options and purchase flows.
- [ ] Handle subscription status changes and entitlement checks.

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Implement a secure way to manage production API keys and environment variables (e.g., using a `.env.production` file and Vite's `loadEnv`).

## Phase 2: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for core modules (e.g., audio processing, state management).

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test the integration between the UI components and the background services.
- [ ] Test the RevenueCat integration in sandbox mode.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical user flows (e.g., starting/stopping recording, completing a purchase).

### Manual QA
- [ ] Perform manual testing across different operating systems and Chrome versions.

## Phase 3: Build & Deployment

### Production Build
- [ ] Configure `vite.config.ts` for an optimized production build (e.g., minification, code splitting).

### Asset Optimization
- [ ] Ensure all images and 3D assets are compressed for production.

### Packaging
- [ ] Create a production-ready `.zip` file for the Chrome Web Store.

### Submission
- [ ] Complete the Chrome Web Store listing, including all required marketing assets and privacy policies.
