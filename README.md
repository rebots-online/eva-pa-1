# Eva: Your Agentic Personal Assistant

Eva is a powerful, Chrome browser-based personal assistant with executive powers designed to streamline your workflow and enhance your productivity. It operates directly within your browser, providing seamless assistance with a wide range of tasks.

The dynamic sphere is a visual interface that provides real-time feedback on Eva's status, such as listening, processing, or responding. This is a visual effect, not the core function of the application.
